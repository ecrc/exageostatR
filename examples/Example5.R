# Another example of the usage of ExaGeoStatR on a distributed memory system with 31 CPU cores, 4 Ã— 4 rectangular array of nodes, ts=960 and, n=250,000 is shown below

n = 250000
hardware = list( ncores = 4 , ts = 960 , pgrid = 4 , qgrid = 4 )        # pecifies the required hardware to execute the code. Here, ncores and ngpus are
# the numbers of CPU cores and GPU accelerators to deploy, ts denotes the tile size
# used for parallelized matrix operations, pgrid and qgrid are the cluster topology parameters
# in case of distributed memory system execution.
